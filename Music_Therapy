<h2 id="yo">Music Genres that can effect your mood</h2>

<ol id="Yo">
<li>Blues- If you’re feeling a little nervous or anxious, you might want to listen to the blues. It may sound counter-intuitive since the blues are…well…blue, but this rhythm of music can slow your heart rate a little and calm you down.</li>
<li>Rock & Punk- These energetic styles of music can boost your mood levels if you let it. If you enjoy it, rock and punk music can give you an adrenaline and energy boost.</li>
<li>Reggae- Got anger management issues? Reggae is one of the types of music genres that can organically chill you out. Some say reggae music is based on the rhythm of the healthy human heart at rest.</li>
<li>Mainstream- Listening to mainstream pop/rock music can be helpful when you want to get that workout in after leaving the office but are feeling a bit blah about it. The steady tempo and predictable rhythm (and lyrics, for that matter) keep your heart rate regular and breathing consistent.</li>
<li>Classic Love Songs- After a break-up, we’re advising you to not listen to romantic songs. Remember the All By Myself scene in Bridget Jones’ Diary? Don’t be a Bridget Jones!</li>
<li>Dance- Who doesn’t need a pick-me-up from time to time? Dance music is definitely the way to go when you want to feel good fast. The fast tempo and high energy levels will make you shake your booty in no time.</li>
<li>Classical- This musical style of yesteryear has the power to uplift and calm a person. It has also been associated with increased brain power, so much that it is used in both hospitals and in schools. Incidentally, it can also can help you (and your kids!) sleep better at night.</li>
<li>Rap & Hip Hop- This genre can alter your mood in a few ways depending on the song’s lyrics, tempo and overall message. Rap songs often promote anger, misogyny and violence, but some people say that rap relaxes them. Maybe avoid ‘gangsta rap’ and choose something with more conscious lyrics.</li>
<li>Heavy Metal- These typically aggressive lyrics and melodies can certainly have certain negative effects on your mood. However, like rap and hip hop, everyone is different and some might argue that people who listen to heavy metal music have higher self-esteem.</li>
<li>Country-T ake a deep breath and then learn that country music has been linked to depression and even suicide. If you’re already feeling low, country music is probably not the best option.</li>
<li>New Age- New Age is largely instrumental with a variety of instruments and sounds from all over the world. Listening to new age music brings about a sense of tranquility and is excellent for meditation and relaxation.</li>
<li>Broadway- Listening to musical soundtracks can be incredibly motivating. It fosters inspiration and a sense of creativity. And who doesn’t feel better after belting out a show tune?</li>
<li>Latino- Latino music is a definite energy booster. Whether it’s a hard day at the office or an overall sense of exhaustion, Latino tunes can effectively eliminate symptoms of fatigue.</li>
<li>Disco This dance music of decades past can get your juices flowing and serves as a good start to lay the foundation for a great day ahead.</li>
<li>Meditation- Ok, this one may not technically be on the list of different music genres, but by listening to meditative music, you can reduce stress levels and anxiety while increasing a sense of tranquility and overall relaxation. </li>
